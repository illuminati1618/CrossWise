    "## **1. Introduction to Binary (Base 2)**\n",
    "###  What is Binary?\n",
    "Binary is a number system that only uses two digits: **0 and 1**. It is the fundamental language of computers, as all digital data is stored and processed using binary values.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Popcorn Hack: Identifying Binary\n",
    "\n",
    "Tip: If the number only contains 1s and 0s, it's binary! To check, just look for digits other than 0 or 1. If they're there, it's not binary!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples for Identifying Binary:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Example 1:**\n",
    "   - Number: `101010`\n",
    "   - <button onclick=\"alert('Is it binary? Yes! All digits are 1\\'s and 0\\'s, so it\\'s binary.')\">Check Answer</button>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Example 2:**\n",
    "   - Number: `12301`\n",
    "   - <button onclick=\"alert('Is it binary? No! The digit 2 is present, which makes it not binary.')\">Check Answer</button>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Example 3:**\n",
    "   - Number: `11001`\n",
    "   - <button onclick=\"alert('Is it binary? Yes! It only contains 1\\'s and 0\\'s.')\">Check Answer</button>\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Why Do Computers Use Binary?\n",

    "\n",
    "- **0 + 1 = 1**  \n",

    "- **1 + 0 = 1**  \n",
    "  Adding one and zero also results in one.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **1 + 1 = 10**  \n",
    "  Adding two ones results in `10`, which means you carry over a `1` to the next column.\n",

    "+ 1101\n",
    "------\n",
    "  10111\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "- Start from the rightmost bit:\n",
    "  - `0 + 1 = 1`  \n",
    "  - `1 + 0 = 1`  \n",
    "  - `0 + 1 = 1`  \n",
    "  - `1 + 1 = 10` (carry the 1)  \n",
    "- The final result is `10111`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tip:  \n",
    "When you have to carry over, remember to add the carry value to the next column.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Carrying Over:\n",
    "- Whenever you get `1 + 1 = 10`, the `0` is placed in the current column, and the `1` is carried over to the next higher column (just like in decimal addition).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Binary Subtraction Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "When subtracting binary numbers, the process is similar to decimal subtraction, with a few rules to keep in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **0 - 0 = 0**\n",
    "   - If both bits are `0`, the result is `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **1 - 0 = 1**\n",
    "   - If the bit being subtracted is `0`, the result is `1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **1 - 1 = 0**\n",
    "   - If both bits are `1`, the result is `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **0 - 1 = 1 (with borrowing)**\n",
    "   - If the bit being subtracted is `1` and the current bit is `0`, you must borrow from the next higher bit.\n",
    "   - The `0` becomes `10`, and the result becomes `1`. This borrowing process continues until a `1` is found to borrow from.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quick Hack for Adding and Subtracting Binary:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Adding binary numbers:**\n",
    "   - Start from the rightmost bit (like normal addition).\n",
