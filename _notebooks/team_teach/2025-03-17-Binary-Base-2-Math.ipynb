    "## **1. Introduction to Binary (Base 2)**\n",
    "###  What is Binary?\n",
    "Binary is a number system that only uses two digits: **0 and 1**. It is the fundamental language of computers, as all digital data is stored and processed using binary values.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Why Do Computers Use Binary?\n",
    "Computers use **binary** because electronic circuits operate with two voltage levels:\n",
    "- **Low voltage (0)**\n",
    "- **High voltage (1)**\n",
